This project is a **Memory Card Matching Game** implemented in JavaScript. It dynamically generates a grid of cards, each containing a hidden image, with pairs randomly assigned from a given image set. The game tracks player actions by recording clicked cards, revealed images, and completed pairs. When two cards are clicked, it checks if they match: if they do, the pair remains revealed; if not, they are hidden again after a short delay. The system keeps track of the number of tries, pairs matched, and determines when the game is won once all pairs are matched. The logic ensures that each image appears exactly twice on randomly chosen cards, creating a fair and unpredictable playthrough every time.
